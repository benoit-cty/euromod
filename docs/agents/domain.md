# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Existing precursors

This repo already carries two documents that a future `CONTEXT.md` or ADR should draw from rather than duplicate:

- **`vocabulary.md`** at the repo root is the project glossary (Nómos codenames, EUROMOD terms, pipeline vocabulary). Treat it as the glossary until a `CONTEXT.md` exists; when one is created, fold `vocabulary.md` into it or have it point there.
- **`07_risks-and-decisions.md`** records the contract-level risks and decisions. New ADRs under `docs/adr/` should reference the entry they refine or supersede.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo. Domain docs live at the root, above the code subprojects:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md                          ← one glossary for the whole system
├── vocabulary.md                       ← existing glossary (precursor)
├── 07_risks-and-decisions.md           ← existing decision log (precursor)
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/                            ← system-wide decisions
│   │   └── 0001-<slug>.md
│   └── agents/                         ← skill configuration (this file)
├── Nomotheca-RAG/                      ← Activity 2: legislation DB + ingestion
├── Nomoscope-agentic-workflow/         ← Activity 3: pipeline + validation UI
├── Nomokrisis-evaluation_pipeline/     ← Activity 4: evaluation
└── mcp-server/
```

The subprojects share one Postgres and one parameter data contract, so their vocabulary is shared too; that is why they are one context rather than several.

For reference, a multi-context repo would instead have a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing at a `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` inside each context directory.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
