# EUROMOD Legislation Ingest

Initial Python implementation of the archive-first ingestion architecture described in
[`../12_ingestion-architecture.md`](../12_ingestion-architecture.md).

The package is library-first: CLI commands call the same `ingest_citation` and
`ingest_instrument` functions that an agentic cache-miss workflow can call in-process.
